Hi I'm Talha Chowdhury, a rising senior at Bennington College. My primary area of studies is CompSci with a focus on AI Product Management. I took this class because of my love for open
source projects. 

# Solo Fixes

I contributed to [Temporary Environment 4 React](https://github.com/cu8code/Temporary-Environment-4-React/pull/29) by fixing some icon visibility issues.

# Learnings 


My major learning in this course was getting out of my comfort zone to contribute to an open source project following the proper steps (such as pull requests, reading documentation, etc.). I've also navigated multiple open source projects which elevated my ability to read code and enhance my understanding of project structures. It was always overwhelming for me to contribute to open source projects because of inivisble fears of doing something wrong and messing it up. But going through this course has helped me get over that fear. I wanted to work on something that I cared about, which is working on a newly initiated project and that goal was fulfilled. Even though the pull request hasn't been accepted, the process I went through to get to that process isn't wasted. I recommend more computer science students to take courses like this that enhance their collaboration skill and make them a better programmer.
