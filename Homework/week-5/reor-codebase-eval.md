### My first issue plan

For my first issue, I'm planning to improve the documentation to a standard form. Since I've worked as a Technical Writer for several summers, this would be my forte. 

### Resources

What I like about this is that they have a [contributing guide](https://www.reorproject.org/docs/documentation/contributing) from the org itself which should provide me with valuable guidance for menaingful contributions.
