I'm thinking about the following Open Source Projects.

[Reor:](https://github.com/reorproject/reor): This is a private and local knowledge management app. I've worked on knowledge management products before and this seems like a project where I can contribute ideas to. 

[GodMode:](https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode): AI Chat Browser written primarily in Javascript and Typescript. This app lets you get quick access to the popular LLM chats.
